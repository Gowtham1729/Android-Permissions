# Android-Permissions
This is a list of all Android Permissions that I could find. I also included permission-groups in this lists. I used these for designing a neural network to predict malware in an android application
Please fell free to use these in your work and also add permissions if new ones come.

If someone wanted to scrap these permissions for the url https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission, you can use the python file that I used.
